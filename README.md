## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Darwin Del Castillo-FernÃ¡ndez (pronouns: Ã‰l/He/Him) 

I am a physician who works at the intersection of epidemiology and health data science, tackling global health challenges.

- I aim to understand how our earliest experiences predispose individuals to cardiometabolic diseases, which can lead to young-onset conditions.
- I handle problems by using reproducible methods and applying both data science and epidemiological methods, motivated by causal questions.
