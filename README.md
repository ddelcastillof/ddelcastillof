## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Darwin Del Castillo-FernÃ¡ndez (pronouns: Ã‰l/He/Him) 

### I am a physician who works at the intersection of epidemiology and healthcare data science to tackle global health challenges.

- I aim to understand how cardiometabolic diseases are preprogrammed by our earliest experiences during gestational and early infancy.
- I handle problems by using reproducible methods and applying both data science and epidemiologic methods motivated by causal questions.
- More info about me on my website: https://ddelcastillof.github.io/darwindelcastillo/
